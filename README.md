# Web Application Penetration Testing (VAPT) – OWASP Based Security Assessment

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Web Application Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) performed on an intentionally vulnerable web application for learning and research purposes.

The assessment was conducted using Kali Linux and industry-standard penetration testing tools. The main goal was to identify security vulnerabilities, understand their impact, and provide remediation recommendations based on OWASP Top 10 guidelines.


## Objective
- Identify common web application vulnerabilities
- Perform vulnerability scanning and manual testing
- Validate and exploit security weaknesses
- Analyze risk severity using CVSS scoring
- Map vulnerabilities to OWASP Top 10
- Suggest security improvements


## Methodology
The testing followed a structured penetration testing approach:

1. Reconnaissance and OSINT Enumeration  
2. Application Fingerprinting  
3. Threat Modeling  
4. Vulnerability Scanning  
5. Manual Exploitation  
6. Risk Analysis  
7. Reporting and Documentation  


## Key Vulnerabilities Identified
- SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass and Database Access)
- Blind SQL Injection
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Sensitive Information Disclosure
- Local File Inclusion (Path Traversal)
- Brute Force Login Vulnerability
- Weak Password Policy
- Missing Security Headers
- Insecure Cookie Configuration
- Clickjacking
- Insecure HTTP Communication


## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Burp Suite
- Nmap
- WhatWeb
- Nikto
- Gobuster
- Nuclei
- SQLMap


## Skills Demonstrated
- Web Application Security Testing
- Ethical Hacking Techniques
- Vulnerability Analysis and Exploitation
- Risk Assessment (CVSS)
- OWASP Top 10 Security Testing
- Security Reporting and Documentation


## Risk Summary

| Severity | Count  |
| Critical |    4   |
| High     |   10   |
| Medium   |   4    |
| Low      |    2   |
| Infor... |    3   |


## Learning Outcome
This project provided hands-on experience in real-world penetration testing workflows and helped in understanding web application security risks, secure coding practices, and security hardening techniques.


## Disclaimer
This project was performed only on an intentionally vulnerable application for educational purposes. No unauthorized systems were tested.
